# Processor generator

This should become a way to describe a processor in configuration files, test it and finally export it into a factorio
blueprint. The development is currently paused in favor of [factorio-debugging](https://github.com/Factorio-debugging/factorio-debugging),
which will be used in this project for debugging.
